##  Steps of Analysis  

### 1. Data Preparation  
- Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure.  
- Checked for missing values and data consistency.  
- Renamed columns for better readability.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Generated descriptive statistics to understand distributions.  
- Visualized demographic variables (age, job, marital, education).  
- Analyzed binary attributes (credit default, mortgage).  

### 3. Response Rate Analysis  
- Calculated response rates across different customer segments.  
- Compared response rates by:  
  - Age groups  
  - Job categories  
  - Marital status  
  - Education levels  

### 4. Temporal Analysis  
- Extracted month of contact and evaluated monthly response rates.  
- Created line charts to compare trends between job categories.  
- Identified best and worst performing months for campaigns.  

### 5. Insights Extraction  
- Highlighted high-response segments (e.g., students, unemployed).  
- Identified seasonal patterns (strong months: March, September, December).  
- Suggested weak periods to avoid (Mayâ€“July).
